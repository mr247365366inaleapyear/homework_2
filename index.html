          Hello, my name is Waleed Ehab McLean. I am currently a full-stack
          developer student in the UNC Coding Bootcamp. I began coding in August
          of 2020, learning different styles and languages. I chose to learn how
          to code for a myriad of reasons, mainly to change careers, learn new
          skills that will help me later on in life, and also to potentially
          teach others how to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was born in Lumberton, North Carolina on February 24, 1986, and grew
          up in Saint Pauls, North Carolina. In 2004, I graduated from Saint
          Pauls High School in Saint Pauls, North Carolina, enrolling at
          Winston-Salem State University shortly after. Unfortunately I had to
          withdraw from the university in 2006 for personal issues. In 2007, I
          began working for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company until I
          resigned in 2020 to take the UNC Bootcamp.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although I withdrew from WSSU, I re-enrolled to the school in 2018,
          switching my concentration from History to Finance and Computer
          Science. I continued going to the school until this past year when I
          decided to not go to school for the Fall 2019/Spring 2020 semester.
          The reason for this was because of finacial issues (I was paying for
          all school expenses myself) and the COVID-19 pandemic.
